OpenShift,current,platforms,FALSE,"PaaS. Reduces the complexity of Kubernetes"
Docker,current,platforms,FALSE,"Parity between development and production, making for reliable deployments. It is a natural fit in a microservices-style application as a packaging mechanism for self-contained services."
Lightweight Architecture Decision Records,current,techniques,FALSE,"It's important to record certain design decisions for the benefit of future team members as well as for external oversight."
Kubernetes,current,platforms,FALSE,"Default solution when deploying containers into a cluster of machines"

Consumer-driven contract testing,current,techniques,FALSE,"Consumer-driven contracts are an essential part of a mature microservice testing portfolio, enabling independent service deployments."
Pipelines as code,current,techniques,FALSE,"The configuration of delivery pipelines that build, test and deploy our applications or infrastructure should be treated as code; they should be placed under source control and modularized in reusable components with automated testing and deployment."
Excalidraw,current,tools,FALSE,"A simple online drawing tool for when you just need a quick picture instead of a formal diagram. For remote teams Excalidraw provides a quick way to create and share diagrams."
Postman,current,tools,FALSE,"A REST client allowing you to create requests and inspect responses. It is a useful tool when developing an API or implementing a client to call an existing API."
IntelliJ IDEA,current,tools,FALSE,"The Java IDE of choice"
VS Code,current,tools,FALSE,"Lightweight IDE/editor choice"
git,current,tools,FALSE,"Come on you know what git is"
ArchUnit,current,tools,FALSE,"Java testing library for checking architecture constraints on build time"
Test driven develpment,current,techniques,FALSE,"Write a failing automated test before changing any code."
Apache Maven,current,tools,FALSE,"Manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information: The pom.xml"
Helm,current,tools,FALSE,"Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes. The set of Kubernetes resources that together define an application is packaged as charts."
Beanstalkd,current,platforms,FALSE,"A small job queue. Not to be confused with AWS ElasticBeanstalk"
Amazon S3,current,platforms,FALSE,"The de-facto standard for storing a large amount of objects in the cloud"
Postgresql,current,platforms,FALSE,"The open source database of choice."
MongoDB,current,platforms,FALSE,"NoSQL. Not a big fan, but it gets some jobs done better than other databases."
Scrum,current,techniques,FALSE,"A lightweight, iterative and incremental framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products"
Representational state transfer APIs (REST),current,techniques,FALSE,"Designing and consuming REST-APIs is daily doing"
SOAP,current,techniques,FALSE,"Sadly I still have to work with this old XML-based protocol too"
Diagrams as code,current,techniques,FALSE,"Having diagrams as code greatly simplifies documentation. I like C4 used with PlantUML"
Prometheus & Grafana,current,tools,FALSE,"For exposing all kinds of metrics"
Sonar,current,tools,FALSE,"Measure code quality, gain insights"
Node.js,current,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"For quick & dirty stuff everyone has their favorites. For me it's Node.js"
React.js,not_in_use,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"My favorite frontend framework. Used it for some years, but would need some time to get used to it again because currently I'm mostly working on Backend and DevOps stuff only."
ECMAScript 6,not_in_use,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"Currently I'm mostly working on Backend and DevOps stuff"
Kanban,not_in_use,techniques,FALSE,"Another agile project management framework. Used it before, but it's not_in_use in my current team"
Spring Batch/Integration,not_in_use,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"Spring way for processing large datasets"
Camunda,not_in_use,platforms, FALSE,"Workflow engine. Great for serving as an orchestrator in a microservice environment. Currently not used by the team I work in."
APIs as a product,exploring,techniques,FALSE,"Expose business capabilities to both external and internal developers. APIs promise the ability to experiment quickly with new business ideas by recombining core capabilities."
Spring Cloud,exploring,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"Provides tools for developers so they can use coordination techniques (like service discovery, load balancing, circuit breaking and health checking) in the familiar Spring environment. But sometimes hides too much of the complexity."
Kafka Streams,exploring,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"Lightweight library to build streaming applications. It supports basic streaming APIs such as join, filter, map and aggregate as well as local storage for common use cases such as windowing and sessions."
GraphQL,exploring,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"A protocol for remotely retrieving object graphs. Better suited than REST APIs for some use cases"
Java 17,exploring,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"New LTS-Version. I use it for my private projects so far"
Kotlin,exploring,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"Nice syntax, null safety, ease of transition from Java and interoperability with other JVM-based languages in general --> I like it"
AWS EC2,exploring,platforms,FALSE,"I make some experiments to learn with this. How to build secure, maintainable resilient architectures using auto-scaling, load balancers, security groups, etc."
AWS RDS,exploring,platforms,FALSE,"AWS managed database service. So far I have used it for private/learning projects only."
AWS CloudFormation,exploring,tools,FALSE,"IaaS as Code. Similar to Terraform"
Eventstore,used_before,platforms,FALSE,"Event-sourcing database. While convenient for some use cases the same can be achieved using persistent Kafka topics"
Redux,used_before,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"State handling for large scale react apps. Not my favorite anymore since the newer React versions"
Heroku,used_before, platforms, FALSE,"PaaS. Good for fast prototypes. But there are better alternatives e.g. in AWS now"
A single CI instance for all teams,used_before,techniques,FALSE,"While it's a nice idea in theory to consolidate and centralize Continuous Integration (CI) infrastructure, in reality we do not see enough maturity in the tools and products in this space to achieve the desired outcome. Software delivery teams which must use the centralized CI offering regularly have long delays depending on a central team to perform minor configuration tasks, or to troubleshoot problems in the shared infrastructure and tooling. At this stage, we continue to recommend that organizations limit their centralized investment to establishing patterns, guidelines and support for delivery teams to operate their own CI infrastructure."
Eclipse IDE,used_before,tools,FALSE,"It was once the best free/open source IDE for Java. Compared to todays standards it does not feel great anymore."
Java Server Faces,used_before,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"A Java framework for building component-based user interfaces for web applications. Was good at its time."
SVN,used_before,tools,FALSE,"Subversion. Became obsolete with git"
