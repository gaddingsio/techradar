Java 17,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"New Java LTS version"
React.js,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"My favorite frontend framework"
Spring Boot,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"If you live in a Spring ecosystem and are moving to microservices, Spring Boot is now the obvious choice. "
ECMAScript 6,adopt,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"The new version of JavaScript, addresses many of the concerns of the older versions currently in use. "
OpenShift,adopt,platforms,FALSE,"PaaS. Reduces the complexity of Kubernetes"
Docker,adopt,platforms,FALSE,"The Docker image format makes it easier to achieve parity between development and production, making for reliable deployments. It is a natural fit in a microservices-style application as a packaging mechanism for self-contained services."
Lightweight Architecture Decision Records,adopt,techniques,FALSE,"It's important to record certain design decisions for the benefit of future team members as well as for external oversight. "
Kubernetes,adopt,platforms,FALSE,"Default solution when deploying containers into a cluster of machines"
Consumer-driven contract testing,adopt,techniques,FALSE,"Consumer-driven contracts are an essential part of a mature microservice testing portfolio, enabling independent service deployments."
Pipelines as code,adopt,techniques,TRUE,"The configuration of delivery pipelines that build, test and deploy our applications or infrastructure should be treated as code; they should be placed under source control and modularized in reusable components with automated testing and deployment."
Excalidraw,adopt,tools,TRUE,"A simple but powerful online drawing tool for when you just need a quick picture instead of a formal diagram. For remote teams Excalidraw provides a quick way to create and share diagrams."
Postman,adopt,tools,FALSE,"A REST client allowing you to create requests and inspect responses. It is a useful tool when developing an API or implementing a client to call an existing API."
IntelliJ IDEA,adopt,tools,FALSE,"The Java IDE of choice"
VS Code,adopt,tools,FALSE,"Lightweight IDE/editor choice"
Amazon S3,adopt,platforms,FALSE,"The de-facto standard for storing a large amount of objects in the cloud"
Postgresql,adopt,platforms,FALSE,"The open source database of choice."
APIs as a product,trial,techniques,TRUE,"Expose business capabilities to both external and internal developers. APIs promise the ability to experiment quickly with new business ideas by recombining core capabilities."
Spring Cloud,trial,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"Provides tools for developers so they can use coordination techniques (like service discovery, load balancing, circuit breaking and health checking) in the familiar Spring environment. But sometimes hides too much of the complexity."
Kafka Streams,trial,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"Lightweight library to build streaming applications. It supports basic streaming APIs such as join, filter, map and aggregate as well as local storage for common use cases such as windowing and sessions."
GraphQL,assess,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"A protocol for remotely retrieving object graphs. Better suited than REST APIs for some use cases"
Eventstore,hold,platforms,FALSE,"Event-sourcing database. While convenient for some use cases the same can be achieved using persistent Kafka topics"
Redux,hold,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"State handling for large scale react apps. Not my favorite anymore since the newer React versions"
Heroku, hold, platforms, FALSE, "PaaS. Good for fast prototypes. But there are better alternatives e.g. in AWS now"
A single CI instance for all teams,hold,techniques,FALSE,"While it's a nice idea in theory to consolidate and centralize Continuous Integration (CI) infrastructure, in reality we do not see enough maturity in the tools and products in this space to achieve the desired outcome. Software delivery teams which must use the centralized CI offering regularly have long delays depending on a central team to perform minor configuration tasks, or to troubleshoot problems in the shared infrastructure and tooling. At this stage, we continue to recommend that organizations limit their centralized investment to establishing patterns, guidelines and support for delivery teams to operate their own CI infrastructure."
